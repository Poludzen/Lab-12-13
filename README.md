This work was created based on https://keras.io/examples/generative/neural_style_transfer/

In the code you can see how the Neural Transfer Style algorithm works in detail: how to calculates losses, gradients, how to process images, and how to transfer styles at all.
Also there are some results : with different styles and contents, with different count of layers of VGG19 neural network, with different count of iterations of transfering.

In this code two styles and two contents are presented:
 Styles of Pablo Picasso and Frida Kahlo, contents from Fight Club movie and Paris city view.
